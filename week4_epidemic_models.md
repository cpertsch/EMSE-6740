# Epidemic Modeling

Please take your time to inhale some of this material. 
The topic is "epidemic modeling" -- super simple to start with, but a lot of depth once you dig in. Let's discuss on Slack -- once you have looked at it for some time, think about this stuff and post more related things on Slack. This has implications in politics, spread of ideas and innovations, etc.

## Tying in with last week's class:

Is depression contagious? Some folks think so.

How would you create an SIR-style model? What would you do different from a "normal" SIR model?


## Obesity contagion on networks
This is a super famous TED talk -- for fun for now -- but tying networks, SIR models and contagion of obesity. We will revisit this later in the course.
